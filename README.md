# make-your-film-festival
 An open source platform to help organizers hosting film festivals

 # Why This Project?
 I love going to film festivals, but I struggle with their websites. Some specific problems:
 - The navigation is not usable. I cannot shifting from browsing the available movies, to then adding them to my festival pack.
 - There is often a short time window in which you need to choose your films, which multiplies this problem.
 - The people organizing the film festivals are not in tech.

We still need to encourage arthouse and independent cinema, so film festivals need to continue.

# The Solution
I'm making an open source film festival website, that helps organizers set up festivals, festival attendees to sign up and view details about the festivals.
My hope is to make the festival attendee experience better, but also to cut costs for the organizers. I'm hoping to make this sufficiently brandable so that different festivals can still use their own personality.
